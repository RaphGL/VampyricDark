## FAQ

###### "Are you going to create a light color scheme?"

Eventually, yes!

###### "Are you going to have a syntax highlighting spec?"

Nope. This is a GUI theme. Dracula already does that well and Vampyric Dark fits well with it so there's no need for duplication.

###### "How do I submit a new theme?"

The project is fairly new, so we're currenly aggregating links only. Make your theme and make an issue and we'll link it. When we have a decent sized catalog of themes we'll make an organization.
